In this exercise, bubble, merge, quick, selection and insertion algorithms, which are sort algorithms, are used. 
each algorithm is individually coded and imported in the "main.py" file. 
When the main file is run, if there is a list according to the user's request, the existing list is created, otherwise, a list is created from the range specified by the user, with the number determined by the user. 
The created list is sorted using these 5 algorithms and the elapsed time is printed. 
In addition, the user can reuse the code as many times as he wants. 
In case of a wrong entry, the user receives a warning and the process is repeated.
